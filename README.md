# Comp330-CPD

## Week 1 - Beginning 24th September
First week back at university and we are straight back into the action, we had a lecture with Ed on development for the NES, I found this really interesting to learn about the constraints and the old archetecture for such an old console. We had a lecture with Gareth who introduced us to what we'd be doing with him which was to make Java applications for a website we'd be creating, I have a few ideas for what I want to make. Java is so useful these days because it is so widely used for many aspects. My new team for making a game this year all met up and we talked about ideas and started prototyping, the ideas were a bit all over the place, we have to narrow them down. My biggest struggle this week was trying to understand the complexity of the NES constraints.

## Week 2 - Beginning 1st October
This week our team came up with some mechanics we are going to use in our game, so the programmers started trying to make them, I was tasked with creating an x-ray mechanic, a limb removal mechanic and limb pinning mechanic, these were fairly challenging to make but I got there in the end. Also this week we were supposed to have our dissertation proposal written, I have chosen to see if I can make games more accessible for the elderly in care homes, I think this will be fun to try and create something so more users can play video games. My biggest struggle this week was the dissertation proposal because I struggled to find lots of relevant sources and I'm not too big on writing which is a shame because it has to be several thousand words long. Gareth had a lecture which told how us to make technical portfolios using Java and HTML, I found this very useful as web development is something I'm interested in pursuing after university for a while.

## Week 3 - Beginning 8th October
This week we had to do our NES de-make proposals, I chose Gears of War because I thought the shooting and melee would be doable with the constraints that are limiting us. Gareth went into more details this week on making games in Java. Ed has set us the task of coming up with an idea and proposal of what game we would like to de-make for the NES. We had a lecture for dissertation on research philisophies, this confused me a little bit as I didn't fully understand the purpose of it. For our team game we started combining some of the ideas we were working on to get them into a cohesive whole. The other programmer was working on a mobile prototype as that was something we were thinking about. My biggest struggle this week was presenting my de-make proposal, presenting has never been my strong point I just get too nervous, but it went alright.
